Day 1
	Write cart logic on custom levels
		Jumping over obstacles
			- Gaps
				- Jump on timer
			- Stationary obstacles / enemies
				- Jump on timer
			- Randomly places stationary obstacles / enemies
				- Add detection for obstacles
					- Ghost collider in front
				- Add detection for gaps
			- Moving enemies
			- Flying enemies
				
Day 2
	Braking
		- Slow down to avoid traps
			- Compressor
			- Swinging mallet
			- Maybe these are on a wire trip?
	Jumping on enemies
	Powerups
		- Speed powerup
			- Don't brake anymore for traps because we're moving fast enough to beat them
			- Don't jump as high
		- 
		
Day 3
	Jump into random generated level (not student generated)
		- Leave gaps in previous two days that don't work here
			- Variable jump heights
			- Take into account our speed
Day 4
	Playing with random generation
		- Decorations
	
Day 5
